Hardware CAD files

This is the repo that contains all of the device CAD drawings.

Each time you "release" a design then tag the entire repo with a tag of the drawing released.

Make sure the tag name is on the board that was tagged.

One tag for each board you release even if you're releasing two boards at the same time.  This way we can always go back and get that device remade as released.
